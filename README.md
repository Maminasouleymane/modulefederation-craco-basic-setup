# Important !!!

don't forget to change the names in modulefederation.config.js and package.json to match your project name

# to run the projet
```
  npm start 
```
### the default port here is 3000 so if you want to run this project in another port inside the package.json you need to update the start script to match the following

```
  "start": "set PORT=3002 && craco start"
```
